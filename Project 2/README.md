# Project 2: Data Analysis

## Overview

In this project, we will conduct a data analysis using the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey dataset. Our goal is to answer the following questions:

1. In which companies do developers earn the most?
2. How important is remote working for workers?
3. How much influence does coding experience have on salary?
4. Do individuals with a master's degree have a better chance of securing a job as a developer?

## Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The environment for developing and executing the code.
- **Pandas**: The library used for data manipulation and analysis.

## Dataset

This analysis will utilize the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey dataset, which provides insights into the developer community, including salary information, work preferences, and educational backgrounds.
